This is just a simple suite of scripts that I use to clone a dualboot hackintosh setup between some machines.
It assumes that the system you are running ins't the one you are manipulating (duh) and that you have previously
shrunk the clients disks and setup the environment you wish.

The execution is pretty straightforward, you just run the startup script and then you run the wrapper with the
given parameters.


This repo also includes a nice little script called reducto (that shrinks ext partitions to their smallest size)
and a dual script to get and import bluetooth keys from a MacOS system to a Linux system running in the same
system (this is for those horrendous Apples 'Magic<peripheral>').
